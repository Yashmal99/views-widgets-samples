Android Views and Widgets Samples Repository
============================================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get
started writing/understanding Android views and widgets features.
The widget package contains (mostly visual) UI elements to use on your Application screen. You can also design your own.
To create your own widget, extend View or a subclass.
